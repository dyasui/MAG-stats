These will be over-estimates of a potential team’s Olympic performance if the domestic judging is less strict than the Olympic Committee judges panels.\nMy code also implicitly uses a 5-up, 3-count scoring system which is different from the actual 3-up, 3-count rule during Olympic team finals. While the US might choose the lineup in this way, they will also probably have to take into account the health of their athletes (e.g., resting Brody’s leg by not having him vault)."

For some context, the gold medal Japanese team at 2023 world championships 2 scored 255.594 and USA won bronze at the same competition with 252.428.\nOn paper this teams strengths relative to international competition seem to be Floor, Pommel, and High Bar with scores of 42.85, 42.75, and 42.075, respectively. However, the US is pretty infamous for not being able to pull together their full potential on Pommel.\nThis team also remains competitive on Rings with an average score of 42.9875 and on P-Bars with a 44.1875. With China being so dominant on those two events they probably won’t win any event final medals there but having those two events as strengths will definitely help the team score against Japan and Great Britain.\nIt’s kind of surprising that the main weakness on paper of this team is vault. With Brody, Paul, and Asher vaulting at a total predicted score of 43.25, they fall behind both China’s and Great Britain’s scores as well as the previous US team’s own score on the event from last year. I heard that judging on Asher’s Ri Se Gwang vault seemed overly harsh, so it’s possible that this team vault score gets better, but I think he’s the only one with a D-score higher than 5.6 on this event.\n\n\nPotential vs Expectations\nThere will also be more psychological strain on these athletes which comes with the media attention and unfamiliar setting in Paris. This could be a factor that could potentially affect this team more than other alternative US teams.\nI was hoping that Yul Muldauer could provide the same kind of leadership he showed at the World Championships to a younger and less-internationally experienced team. Unfortunately he didn’t perform up to his usual level of execution and consistency in these past few competitions so I understand why he was left off. These five guys (with maybe the exception of Paul?) have experience competing at the World/Olympic level, but I think Yul is one of those guys who gets along with everyone and feels comfortable in the spotlight. I think Fred has a very similar enthusiasm and drive, but this is still only his second year of competing at the senior international level.\nThe first night of the Olympic Trials made me pretty nervous about the ability for US gymnasts to stay consistent with increased attention on them. It was great to see how full the stadium in Minneapolis was for men’s gymnastics, but I also thought that some of the extra shakiness on Pommel and throughout the night might have been attributable to all the extra energy around. This team has a lot of potential and I just hope that they don’t get overwhelmed by the pressure of thinking that they need to live up to the high expectations of a domestic audience who only tune in every four years with the anticipation that anything team USA touches at the Olympics could turn to gold.\n\n\nComparing to the rest of the field\n\nteam_scores &lt;- indv.averages_df %&gt;% \n    filter(NAME %in% team_names) %&gt;%\n    select(-AA) %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n      -NAME,\n      names_to = \"Event\",\n      values_to = \"Score\",\n    )\neventsdist +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = team_scores, \n    aes(\n      xintercept = Score, \n      color = Score,\n      ),\n      linetype = \"dashed\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = team_scores, \n    aes(\n      y = 0.4,\n      x = Score,\n      label = NAME,\n      color = Score\n      ),\n    angle = 270,\n    size = 2,\n    nudge_x = 0.05,\n    ) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"turbo\", direction = -1) +\n  xlim(12, 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Olympic team’s scores relative to everyone else"
